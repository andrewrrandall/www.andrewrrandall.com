Building websites is tough business. 
<br></br>
I have a bit of 'progamming' experience myself, and starting 
this website from 'scratch' has proven a bit harder than I thought. 
<br></br>
I'm hosting this website via replit.com, but I may end up moving off of it and try to migrate everything to a django web framework because I keep running out of CPU in my replit repo. 
<br></br>
Anyway, I now understand why people would quickly give up on these pet projects and move to a website designer like Webflow or Squarespace.
